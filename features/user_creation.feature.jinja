Feature: User Creation
  As a user of the system
  I want to create new users
  So that they can access the application

  Scenario: Create user with valid email
    Given I have a username "testuser"
    And I have an email "test@example.com"
    When I create a user
    Then the user should be created successfully
    And the user should have username "testuser"
    And the user should have email "test@example.com"
    And the user should be active

  Scenario: Create user with invalid email
    Given I have a username "testuser"
    And I have an email "invalid-email"
    When I create a user
    Then the user creation should fail
    And I should see an error message containing "Invalid email"

  Scenario: Create user with empty email
    Given I have a username "testuser"
    And I have an email ""
    When I create a user
    Then the user creation should fail
    And I should see an error message containing "Email cannot be empty"
